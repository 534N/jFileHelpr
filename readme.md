# jFileHelpr

jFileHelpr is extracted from a project I built for the company based on the jFileUpload by [Sebastian Tschan's](https://blueimp.net/). The project I extracted from normally processes file from hundreds of thousands lines to 2 millions lines of text, for this extracted version, I changed the input file to jSON, the point is just to demonstrate what can be done with this system. 


## Prerequisite
1. PHP 5.5
2. MySQL 5.5 (optional)

## To get a feel of it
1. Clone or download the file package, 
2. Add it to your htdocs folder or wherever you have your document root
3. chmod -R 777 storage
4. mkdir /public/uploads/users
5. chmod 777 /public/uploads/users

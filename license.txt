Terms of Service

Last modified: May 10, 2013
By using this API, you consent to be bound by these terms in addition to the Google APIs Terms of Service ("API ToS") at https://developers.google.com/terms.
Deprecation Policy

Google will announce if it intends to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to this API or Service. Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate those Google Chart Tools versions and features identified at http://developers.google.com/chart/chart-api-list without these changes until April 20, 2015, unless (as Google determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):

required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in applicable law or relationship), or
doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.
The above policy is the "Deprecation Policy."

After April 20, 2015, this Deprecation Policy will not apply.
